Project Title: Java Grading System

Project Overview:
Create a Java program that allows users to input student grades and calculates their final grades and letter grades based on predefined grading criteria.

Project Structure:

1.Main Class: Create a main class called GradingSystem to handle user input and interaction.

2.Student Class: Create a Student class to represent student objects. Each Student should have attributes such as name, student ID, and an array or list to store their grades.

3.Grading Criteria: Define the grading criteria, which might include categories like assignments, quizzes, exams, and participation, along with respective weights.

4.User Input: Implement user input mechanisms to allow the user to input the student's name, student ID, and grades for each category.

5.Grade Calculation: Calculate the final grade based on the grading criteria and weights. You can use formulas like weighted averages to do this.

6.Letter Grade Calculation: Based on the final grade, determine the corresponding letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F) using predefined ranges.

7.Display Results: Display the student's name, student ID, individual category grades, final grade, and letter grade to the user.
